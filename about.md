###### FAQ

**Q:** What is a pacer / crew, and why do I need one for my next race?

**A:** A pacer is someone that runs a section of your race (usually an ultramarathon distance event) with the runner to help motivate and assist. A crew member supports the runner in as many aspects of the event, without actually running during the race with him or her. 



**Q:** How exactly does this work? What happens after I submit the form?

**A:** I read through all the details of the race as well as what you can provide as the racer. If it fits my schedule and I can afford whatever extra expenses there might be, we can have a pace party!
